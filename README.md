# Music Library Project

## Overview
The Music Library Project is a simple Java-based application designed to manage and search a collection of music albums and songs. This project is structured using a simplified Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. The primary goal is to load album data from text files (stored in a `resources` folder), maintain the order of songs, and eventually allow users to search and manage their music library.

## Features
- **Album Data Loading:** Reads album metadata and song lists from text files.
- **Ordered Song Storage:** Maintains the exact order of songs as listed in each album file.
- **Simple Text-Based User Interface:** Provides basic commands to interact with the music library.
- **Modular Architecture:** Organized into packages (`model`, `store`, `view`) for clarity and ease of maintenance.
- **Testing:** Includes unit tests for key backend components to ensure at least 90% code coverage.
- **Documentation:** Includes Javadoc comments for classes and methods to facilitate understanding and use of the code.
